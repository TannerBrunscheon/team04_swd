When the Civics Api is requested to get information for the congressional district and
the county the first thing it does is sets up a requestor with Google to get the information from the server
based on the address given. When it receives that information, it parses it for the congressional district that
the address is in and for the county the address is in. It returns that.

When setting the candidates in general database management takes in the location(for president there is none, for senate its
state and for house its state and district) and then looks up that appropriate spot in the database and sends back the dem candidate
and the republican candidate.

When a vote is sent in it will take in the location as well(For president it state, for senate its state and county and for house its state
and district) then it will take that information and look for the matching information in the database and increment the value of that
location with their vote.
