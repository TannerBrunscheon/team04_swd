Usage for Auditors:
The auditor GUI is used to modify the candidates running in specific districts/counties in specific
elections. When an auditor accesses the auditor GUI, they will be able to first select a race.
Their options will be either a senate, house, or presidential race. Once they select the race,
they will enter in the information of the state and district that they would like to
modify the candidates of. Once this is done, they can type in the Republican and Democrat textfields
entering the candidates that are running in the district/county they selected.


Usage for voters:
The voter GUI is to be used by registered voters who are wanting to place a vote in a house, senate
or presidential election. The user must first enter their address, so that the correct voting district
or county can be registered. When they hit submit, a new window will appear, this is the user's voting
ballot. The user can then check the boxes of the candidates that wish for each position and hit submit
upon finishing. The user's vote will then be safely (not really) transmitted to a database where
their votes will be added.
